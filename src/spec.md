## Summary
**Goal:** Update the site’s displayed brand name to exactly “learning& Earning” across key UI and metadata.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the header brand text next to the logo to “learning& Earning” on all routes.
- Update the footer copyright brand name to “learning& Earning” while keeping the current year auto-updating.
- Update the app logo image alt text to include the exact brand name “learning& Earning”.
- Update the HTML document title (`<title>`) to exactly “learning& Earning”.

**User-visible outcome:** The header, footer, logo alt text, and browser tab title all display “learning& Earning”, with no remnants of the previous brand name in the header.
